We define entity-based scene understanding as the task of identifying the entities in a visual scene 
from multiple descriptions by a) identifying coreference and subset relations between entity mentions, 
and b) grounding entity mentions to image regions. We apply our models to two datasets (Flickr30K 
Entities v2 and MSCOCO) and show that grounding can benefit significantly from relation prediction in 
both cases.
