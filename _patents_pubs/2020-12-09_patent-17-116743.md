This invention describes a method for combining locations of arbitrary 
granularity and predicting semantic categories for those groupings. In this 
context, a location can refer to anything from an individual place of interest 
to a larger administrative area like a neighborhood or city. Similarly, a 
semantic category could be equally expressive, encompassing things like 
"family friendly," "safe for travelers," or "trendy".
