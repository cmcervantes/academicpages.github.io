Landmarks are central to how people navigate, but most navigation technologies do not incorporate 
them into their representations. We propose the landmark graph generation task (creating landmark-based 
spatial representations from natural language) and introduce a fully end-to-end neural approach to 
generate these graphs. We evaluate our models on the SAIL route instruction dataset, as well as on a 
small set of real-world delivery instructions that we collected, and we show that our approach yields 
high quality results on both our task and the related robotic navigation task.
