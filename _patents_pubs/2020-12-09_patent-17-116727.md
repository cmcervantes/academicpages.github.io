This invention describes a broad mechanism to create real-valued vector 
representations that encode locations' semantic and spatial properties for 
use in downstream tasks like search, question answering, relation prediction, 
and so on. The invention's methods draw heavily on prior art, but incorporate 
significant modifications to capture the complex, high-level multi-model 
information that defines locations. 

<!---
The main distinction between this and 17/116717 is that this one is more 
a general skip-gram / vgg / etc method for constructing embedding and that 
is a specific mechanism for incorporating multi-model data (like text).
