This invention aims to produce dense representations (embeddings)
for location entities through the combination of spatial and 
structured information (e.g. present in a knowledge graph) with 
unstructured information (e.g. web-scraped text). These representations 
are constructed using representation learning techniques (e.g. Deepwalk) and 
traditional natural language processing tools.

NOTE: this is the hypergraph patent, where we do the deepwalk thing 
_and also_ connnect text nodes with semantic similarity, which my experiments 
showed was very helpful
