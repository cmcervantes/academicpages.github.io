We propose the narrative fragment - a sequence of story events - and a method for 
automatically creating these fragments with narrative generation through partial 
order planning and analysis through n-gram modeling. The generated plans establish 
causal and temporal relationships, and by modeling those relationships and creating 
fragments, our system learns narrative knowledge.
