<p>The github repositories below contain the majority of code written during graduate school in service of the Image Caption projects. While the majority of code began and remained written in Java, the machine learning modules were eventually migrated to Python (using Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow).</p>

<h2>ImageCaptionLearn (<a href="https://github.com/cmcervantes/ImageCaptionLearn">repo</a>) </h2>
<p>ImageCaptionLearn is the main Java application for handling image caption data (e.g. Flickr30k Entities, MSCOCO), generating features from that data, and performing integer linear programming inference (using Gurobi).</p>

<h2>ImageCaptionTools (<a href="https://github.com/cmcervantes/ImageCaptionTools">repo</a>) </h2>
<p>ImageCaptionTools is an integral component of the overall ImageCaptionLearn project, contianing all of the various utilities and structures needed to manipulate image caption data. The Tools were put into their own project, rather than being included in Learn, to allow other lab members to more easily incorporate the image caption structures without needing to include all the preprocessing and inference code present in Learn.</p>

<h2>ImageCaptionLearn_py (<a href="https://github.com/cmcervantes/ImageCaptionLearn_py">repo</a>)</h2>
<p>ImageCaptionLearn_py contains all the code needed to train models (both standard classification and neural networks).</p>

<h2>ImageCaptionAnnotation (<a href="https://github.com/cmcervantes/ImageCaptionAnnotation">repo</a>)</h2>
<p>ImageCaptionAnnotation was originally written in service of the Flickr30kEntities v2 re-annotation effort, intended to allow multiple users to clean up image caption annotations by hand. Using JavaScript and PHP, these pages display image caption data and enable users to re-annotate that data and push their changes to a database.</p>
