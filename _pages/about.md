I am a senior artificial intelligence researcher focusing on natural language processing (NLP) 
and computer vision. 

Over the course of my career I've gained experience in all parts of the 
software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to development to QA, but my real 
strength is the research and development of state-of-the-art solutions to unique and
challenging problems. In my current role at HERE Technologies, I've presented complex 
material to technical and non-technical audiences, mentored junior researchers, 
worked in global, cross-functional teams to define business needs, and applied 
novel machine learning approaches to solve complex problems and provide actionable insights.

Though I chose to leave my Ph.D. program with an M.S. degree, I am passionate about 
advancing the cutting edge in artificial intelligence research (particularly NLP) 
and bringing those technologies to bear on complex, open-ended problems. My Master's thesis, 
[Entity-Based Scene Understanding for Flickr30k and MSCOCO](/projects/2018-02_entity-based-scene-understanding), 
explored techniques for joint coreference resolution and grounding text to images. 
My more recent work has focused on understanding spatial representations from text descriptions 
and leveraging knowledge graphs to improve semantic search.
