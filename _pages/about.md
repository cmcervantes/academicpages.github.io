My current work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagn focuses 
on the intersection between natural language processing (NLP) and 
computer vision. My Master's thesis work -- Entity-Based Scene Understanding
for Flickr30k and MSCOCO -- focuses on identifying the entities in a 
scene from an image with multiple descriptions. Specifically, this project 
predicts mutually consistent coreference and bridging relations between 
noun phrases as well as associations between those phreases and the image 
regions to which they refer. 

As pat of this project, I have
* Managed large datasets (millions of examples) with MySQL and SQLite databases
* Created interactive web pages (using JavaScript and PHP) enabling 
  users to produce detailed image caption annotations
* Analayzed and extracted features for image caption data using 
  Java NLP libraries like 
  [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) 
  and [Illinois CogComp](https://github.com/CogComp/cogcomp-nlp)
* Implemented linear classifiers (using Scikit-Learn) and neural 
  classifiers (using TensorFlow); incorporated classifier predictions in
  integer linear program inference (solved with Gurobi)

Working on this project has enabled me to continue to develop the skills I
used during my time in industry -- particularly Java and Python development -- 
while putting into practice topics I learned in my courses at UIUC:
machine learning, NLP, computer vision, and deep learning.
