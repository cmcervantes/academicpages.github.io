Presented to the HERE research organization on the theory and practice of 
graph neural network construction, with particular focus on implementing graph 
attention networks in Pytorch.

The notebook created for this presentation can be found 
[<u>on my Github</u>](https://github.com/cmcervantes/graph_attn_nets/blob/master/graph_attn_nets.ipynb).
