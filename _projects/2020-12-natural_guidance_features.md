exec_summary: "Our goal in this project is to automatically identify 
and localize storefronts from street-level imagery, given a reference image. 
That is, if we have a good reference image for a storefront, we aim to construct 
computer vision techniques for automatically finding that storefront in other 
street-level images (e.g. dash-cam images). Once created, these methods will then 
be used in a product which determines whether street-level landmarks are salient 
enough to be used as navigation cues (e.g. 'turn left at the post office'). "
academic_summary: "Work on this project is ongoing, but our current methods 
include U-Net and ResNet methods for semantic segmentation (i.e. masks for 
the reference storefront in query images). It is our expectation that new 
methods will be developed to more robustly handle the unique computer 
vision challenges present in street-level imagery."
