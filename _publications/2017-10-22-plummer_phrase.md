permalink: /publication/2017-10-22-plummer_phrase
excerpt: 'This  paper  presents  a  framework  for  localization  or grounding  of  phrases  in  images  using a  large  collection of  linguistic  and  visual  cues.   We  model  the  appearance, size, and position of entity bounding boxes, adjectives that contain attribute information, and spatial relationships between pairs of entities connected by verbs or prepositions. Special attention is given to relationships between people and clothing or body part mentions, as they are useful for distinguishing individuals.'
